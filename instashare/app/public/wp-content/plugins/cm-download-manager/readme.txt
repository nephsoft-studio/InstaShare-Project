> [More FAQ's](hhttps://www.cminds.com/wordpress-plugins-library/downloadsmanager/#faq/)

> [Detailed User Guide](https://creativeminds.helpscoutdocs.com/category/8-download-manager-cmdm)

= How can I customize the look & feel of the plugin? =
In your template you can create a directory called "CMDM". Inside this you can place a structure that is similar to the one inside "cm-download-manager/views/frontend/". If the file can be found in your template directory, then it will have a priority. Otherwise, the default file from the plugin directory will be used.
